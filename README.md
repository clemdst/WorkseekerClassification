This notebook contains the project I led in 2023 with a team of three students from my school, for an hackathon organized by Ekimetrics. 
The subject was "Unbiaised classification algorithm" ; we had to work on data from StackOverFlow, were the features represented some characteristics of the workseeker, and the predicted variable Y was whether he was employed or not.
