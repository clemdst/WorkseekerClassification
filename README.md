# Hackathon - Unbiaised candidates selection model for HR department

This notebook contains the project I led in 2023 with a team of two other students from my school - Pierre Clayton (https://github.com/Pierre-Clayton) and FÃ©lix Gabin Djumene - for an hackathon organized by Ekimetrics. 
The main objective was to construct an unbiaised candidates selection model for HR department ; we had to work on data from StackOverFlow, were the features represented some characteristics of the workseeker, and the predicted variable Y was whether he was employed or not.
